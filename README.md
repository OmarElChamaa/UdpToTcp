# Projet AR

This was a university project in which we had to implement TCP protocols using UDP.
More precisely, we implemented the three-way handshake, stop'n wait and four-way handshake. We were unfortunately not able to complete the go-back-n protocol in time.

The main objective was to compare transmission speeds of stop n wait and go-back-n while simulating packet loss.
